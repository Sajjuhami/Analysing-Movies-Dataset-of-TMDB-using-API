# Analysing-Movies-Dataset-of-TMDB-using-API
This project is to see how to fetch data using API and make DataFrame from the TMDB movie dataset which contains data of around 11,000 movies.

Conducted in-depth analysis of the TMDB movie dataset using API integration: Leveraging the TMDB API, retrieved and processed a large-scale movie dataset, consisting of various attributes such as genres, ratings, budgets, and release dates. Employed Python programming and data manipulation techniques to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

Applied advanced data analytics and visualization techniques to extract key trends and patterns: Utilized statistical analysis, exploratory data analysis, and visualization libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns within the movie dataset. Generated visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to effectively communicate findings and facilitate data-driven decision-making in the film industry.
